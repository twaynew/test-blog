Well, well, so this is a blog.  Am I a blogger now?

$$ x = y^2 $$

...the above was successful blocked; the below should be equivalent:

\\[ x = y^2 \\]

inline:  \\(\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}\\)



This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline:  $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

...the above `$` syntax was corrected with escape backslashes:  \\(\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2\\)
